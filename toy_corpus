anarchism 
anarchism is a political philosophy encompassing theories and attitudes which consider the state to be unnecessary  harmful  and/ or undesirable 
specific anarchists may have additional criteria for what constitutes anarchism  and they often disagree with each other on what these criteria are 
according to  the oxford companion to philosophy    there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold  and those considered anarchists at best share a certain family resemblance 
there are many types and traditions of anarchism  not all of which are mutually exclusive 
anarchism is usually considered to be a radical left-wing ideology  and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism  collectivism  syndicalism or participatory economics  however  anarchism has always included an economic and legal individualist strain  with that strain supporting an anarchist free-market economy and private property  like classical mutualism or today anarcho-capitalism and agorism  
others  such as panarchists and anarchists without adjectives  neither advocate nor object to any particular form of organization as long as it is not compulsory 
some anarchist schools of thought differ fundamentally  supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism 
the central tendency of anarchism as a social movement is represented by communist anarchism  with anarcho-individualism being primarily a literary phenomenon 
some anarchists fundamentally oppose all forms of coercion  while others have supported the use of some coercive measures  including violent revolution and terrorism  on the path to anarchy 
the term  anarchism  derives from the greek    anarchos   meaning  without rulers   from the prefix -   an-    without       arch    sovereignty  realm  magistracy    -   -ismos   from a stem -   -izein   
there is some ambiguity with the use of the terms  libertarianism  and  libertarian  in writings about anarchism 
since the nineteenth century  the term  libertarianism  has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the <!DIGIT!> in the united states  its use as a synonym is still common outside the u s accordingly  libertarian socialism  sometimes is used as a synonym for non-individualist anarchism  that is  socialist anarchism  to dilineate it from individualist libertarianism  individualist anarchism  
on the other hand  some of those who do not use  libertarianism  as a synonym for anarchism but use it to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only  sometimes refer to free-market anarchism as  libertarian anarchism 
origins 
some claim anarchist themes can be found in the works of taoist sages laozi and zhuangzi 
the latter has been translated   there has been such a thing as letting mankind alone  there has never been such a thing as governing mankind with success   and  a petty thief is put in jail 
a great brigand becomes a ruler of a state 
diogenes of sinope and the cynics  and their contemporary zeno of citium  the founder of stoicism  also introduced similar topics 
modern anarchism  however  sprang from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment  particularly jean-jacques rousseau s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom 
although by the turn of the <!DIGIT!> century the term  anarchist  had an entirely positive connotation  it first entered the english language in <!DIGIT!> during the english civil war as a term of abuse used by royalists to damn those who were fomenting disorder 
by the time of the french revolution some  such as the  enrags   began to use the term positively  in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power  seeing  revolutionary government  as oxymoronic 
from this climate william godwin developed what many consider the first expression of modern anarchist thought 
godwin was  according to peter kropotkin   the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism  even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work 
the first to describe himself as an anarchist was pierre-joseph proudhon  which led some to call him the founder of modern anarchist theory 
proudhon proposed spontaneous order  whereby organization emerges without central authority  a  positive anarchy  where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes  and where  business transactions alone produce the social order 
like godwin  proudhon opposed violent revolutionary action 
he saw anarchy as  a form of government or constitution in which public and private consciousness  formed through the development of science and law  is alone sufficient to maintain order and guarantee all liberties 
in it  as a consequence  the institutions of the police  preventive and repressive methods  officialdom  taxation  etc  are reduced to a minimum 
in it  more especially  the forms of monarchy and intensive centralization disappear  to be replaced by federal institutions and a pattern of life based on the commune 
by  commune   proudhon meant local self-government or according to literal translation   municipality   rather than a communist arrangement 
individualist anarchism 
individualist anarchism comprises several traditions which hold that  individual conscience and the pursuit of self-interest should not be constrained by any collective body or public authority 
individualist anarchism is supportive of property being held privately  unlike the social/ socialist/ collectivist/ communitarian wing which advocates common ownership 
individualist anarchism has been espoused by individuals such as max stirner  william godwin  henry david thoreau  josiah warren and murray rothbard 
william godwin 
in <!DIGIT!>  godwin who has often been cited as the first anarchist  wrote  political justice   which some consider to be the first expression of anarchism 
godwin  a philosophical anarchist  opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present  necessary evil  that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge 
godwin advocated extreme individualism  proposing that all cooperation in labor be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good 
godwin was a utilitarian who believed that all individuals are not of equal value  with some of us  of more worth and importance  than others depending on our utility in bringing about social good 
therefore he does not believe in equal rights  but the person s life that should be favored that is most conducive to the general good 
godwin opposed government because he saw it as infringing on the individual s right to  private judgement  to determine which actions most maximize utility  but also makes a critique of all authority over the individual s judgement 
this aspect of godwin s philosophy  stripped of utilitarian motivations  was developed into a more extreme form later by stirner 
egoism 
the most extreme form of individualist anarchism  called  egoism   was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism  max stirner  stirner s  the ego and its own   published in <!DIGIT!>  is a founding text of the philosophy 
according to stirner s conception  the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire  without regard for god  state  or moral rules 
to stirner  rights were  spooks  in the mind  and he held that society does not exist but  the individuals are its reality  he supported a concept of property held by force of might rather than moral right 
by  property  he is not referring only to things but to other people as well 
stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw  associations of egoists  where respect for ruthlessness drew people together 
even murder is permissible  if it is right for me 
stirner saw the state as illegitimate but did not see individuals as having a duty to eliminate it nor does he recommend that they try to eliminate it  rather  he advocates that they disregard the state when it conflicts with their autonomous choices and go along with it when doing so is conducive to their interests 
however  while he thought there was no duty to eliminate state  he does think it will eventually collapse as a result of the spread of egoism 
in russia  individualist anarchism inspired by stirner combined with an appreciation for friedrich nietzsche attracted a small following of bohemian artists and intellectuals such as lev chernyi  as well as a few lone wolves who found self-expression in crime and violence 
they rejected organizing  believing that only unorganized individuals were safe from coercion and domination  believing this kept them true to the ideals of anarchism 
this type of individualist anarchism inspired anarcho-feminist emma goldman 
though stirner s egoism is individualist  it has also influenced some anarcho-communists 
forms of libertarian communism such that developed by the situationist international are strongly egoist in nature 
the american tradition 
another form of individualist anarchism was advocated by the  boston anarchists   american individualists who supported private property exchangeable in a free market 
they advocated the protection of liberty and property by private contractors  and endorsed exchange of labor for wages 
they did not have a problem that  one man employ another  or that  he direct him   in his labor but demanded that  all natural opportunities requisite to the production of wealth be accessible to all on equal terms and that monopolies arising from special privileges created by law be abolished 
they believed state monopoly capitalism  defined as a state-sponsored monopoly  prevented labor from being fully rewarded 
even among the nineteenth century american individualists  there was not a monolithic doctrine  as they disagreed amongst each other on various issues including intellectual property rights and possession versus property in land 
a major cleft occurred later in the <!DIGIT!> century when tucker and some others abandoned natural rights and converted to an  egoism  modeled upon stirner s philosophy 
some  boston anarchists   like tucker  identified themselves as  socialist   a term which at the time denoted a broad concept  by which he meant a commitment to solving  the labor problem  by radical economic reform 
by the turn of the <!DIGIT!> century  the heyday of individualist anarchism had passed  although it was later revived with modifications by murray rothbard and the anarcho-capitalists in the mid-twentieth century  as a current of the broader libertarian movement  and the anti-capitalist strain by intellectuals such as kevin carson 
proudhon s mutualism 
mutualism began in <!DIGIT!> century english and french labor movements before taking an anarchist form associated with pierre-joseph proudhon in france and others in the united states 
proudhon s ideas were introduced by charles a dana  to individualist anarchists in the united states including benjamin tucker and william batchelder greene 
mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity  free association  voluntary contract  federation  and credit and currency reform 
according to greene  in the mutualist system each worker would receive  just and exact pay for his work  services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost  without profit or discount 
mutualism has been retrospectively characterized as being ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism 
proudhon first characterized his goal as a  third form of society  the synthesis of communism and property 
social anarchism 
social anarchism is one of two different broad categories of anarchism  the other category being individualist anarchism 
the term social anarchism is often used to identify communitarian forms of anarchism that emphasize cooperation and mutual aid 
social anarchism includes anarcho-collectivism  anarcho-communism  libertarian socialism  anarcho-syndicalism  social ecology and sometimes mutualism 
collectivist anarchism 
collectivist anarchism   also referred to as  revolutionary socialism  or a form of such  is a revolutionary form of anarchism  commonly associated with mikhail bakunin and johann most 
it is a specific tendency  not to be confused with the broad category sometimes called collectivist or communitarian anarchism 
unlike mutualists  collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production  instead advocating that ownership be collectivized 
this was to be achieved through violent revolution  first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence  or  propaganda by the deed   which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production 
however  collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income  as workers would be paid according to time worked  rather than receiving goods being distributed  according to need  as in anarcho-communism 
this position was criticised by later anarcho-communists as effectively  upholding the wages system  
anarchist communist and collectivist ideas were not mutually exclusive  although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labor  some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need 
collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with marxism but opposed the marxist dictatorship of the proletariat  despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society 
anarchist communism 
anarchist communists propose that the freest form of social organisation would be a society composed of self-governing communes with collective use of the means of production  organized by direct democracy  and related to other communes through federation 
however  some anarchist communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy  feeling that it can impede individual liberty and favor consensus democracy 
in anarchist communism  as money would be abolished  individuals would not receive direct compensation for labour  through sharing of profits or payment  but would have free access to the resources and surplus of the commune 
according to anarchist communist peter kropotkin and later murray bookchin  the members of such a society would spontaneously perform all necessary labour because they would recognize the benefits of communal enterprise and mutual aid 
kropotkin believed that private property was one of the causes of oppression and exploitation and called for its abolition  advocating instead common ownership 
kropotkin said that  houses  fields  and factories will no longer be private property  and that they will belong to the commune or the nation and money  wages  and trade would be abolished 
in response to those criticizing kropotkin for supporting expropriation of homes and means of production from those who did not wish to take part in anarcho-communism  he replied that if someone did not want to join the commune they would be left alone as long as they are a  peasant who is in possession of just the amount of land he can cultivate   or  a family inhabiting a house which affords them just enough space  considered necessary for that number of people  or an artisan  working with their own tools or handloom 
arguing that  the landlord owes his riches to the poverty of the peasants  and the wealth of the capitalist comes from the same source 
the status of anarchist communism within anarchism is disputed  because most individualist anarchists consider communitarianism incompatible with political freedom 
however anarcho communism does not always have a communitarian philosophy  some forms of anarchist communism are strongly egoist  and are strongly influenced by radical individualist philosophy  believing that anarcho-communism does not require a communitarian nature at all 
anarchist communist emma goldman blended the philosophies of both max stirner and kropotkin in her own 
platformism is an anarchist communist tendency in the tradition of nestor makhno  who argued for the  vital need of an organization which  having attracted most of the participants in the anarchist movement  would establish a common tactical and political line for anarchism and thereby serve as a guide for the whole movement 
anarchism without adjectives 
anarchism without adjectives   in the words of historian george richard esenwein   referred to an unhyphenated form of anarchism  that is  a doctrine without any qualifying labels such as communist  collectivist  mutualist  or individualist 
for others  it was simply understood as an attitude that tolerated the coexistence of different anarchist schools 
anarchism without adjectives  emphasizes harmony among various anarchist factions and attempts to unite them around their shared anti-authoritarian beliefs 
the position was first adopted in <!DIGIT!> by fernando tarrida del mrmol as a call for toleration  after being troubled by the  bitter debates  among the different anarchist movements 
voltairine de cleyre  errico malatesta  and fred woodworth are noteworthy exponents of the view 
anarcho-syndicalism 
in the early <!DIGIT!> century  anarcho-syndicalism arose as a distinct school of thought within anarchism 
with greater focus on the labour movement than previous forms of anarchism  syndicalism posits radical trade unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change  replacing capitalism and the state with a new society  democratically self-managed by the workers 
anarcho-syndicalists seek to abolish the wage system and private ownership of the means of production  which they believe lead to class divisions 
important principles include workers  solidarity  direct action  such as general strikes and workplace recuperations   and workers  self-management 
this is compatible with other branches of anarchism  and anarcho-syndicalists often subscribe to anarchist communist or collectivist anarchist economic systems 
its advocates propose labour organization as a means to create the foundations of a non-hierarchical anarchist society within the current system and bring about social revolution 
an early leading anarcho-syndicalist thinker was rudolf rocker  whose <!DIGIT!> pamphlet  anarchosyndicalism  outlined a view of the movement s origin  aims and importance to the future of labour 
although more often associated with labor struggles of the early <!DIGIT!> century  particularly in france and spain   many syndicalist organizations are active today  united across national borders by membership in the international workers association  including the central organisation of the workers of sweden  sac  in sweden  the  unione sindacale italiana   usi  in italy  the cnt in spain  and the industrial workers of the world in the united states 
post-classical schools of thought 
anarchism continues to generate many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements  since the revival of anarchism in the u s in the <!DIGIT!>  a number of new movements and schools have emerged 
anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state libertarianism as a rejuvenated form of individualist anarchism  while the burgeoning feminist and environmentalist movements also produced anarchist offshoots 
post-left anarchy is a tendency which seeks to distance itself from the traditional  left  and to escape the confines of ideology in general 
post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary  leftist  movements  single issue causes and calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought  and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside the leftist milieu 
post-anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought developed by saul newman and associated with thinkers such as todd may  gilles deleuze and flix guattari 
it draws from a wide range of ideas including autonomism  post-left anarchy  situationism  postcolonialism and zapatismo 
another recent form of anarchism critical of formal anarchist movements is insurrectionary anarchism  which advocates informal organization and active resistance to the state  its proponents include wolfi landstreicher and alfredo m bonanno 
anarcho-capitalism 
anarcho-capitalism  or  free market anarchism   is  based on a belief in the freedom to own private property  a rejection of any form of governmental authority or intervention  and the upholding of the competitive free market as the main mechanism for social interaction 
because of the historically anti-capitalist nature of much of anarchist thought  the status of anarcho-capitalism within anarchism is disputed particularly by communist anarchists 
anarcho-capitalists distinguish between free market capitalism  peaceful voluntary exchange  from  state capitalism  which murray rothbard defined as a collusive partnership between big business and government that uses coercion to subvert the free market 
whether in its natural rights-based  contractarian  or utilitarian formulations  anarcho-capitalism has a theory of legitimacy that supports private property as long as it was obtained by labor  trade  or gift 
in an anarcho-capitalist society  its proponents hold  voluntary market processes would result in the provision of social institutions such as law enforcement  defence and infrastructure by competing for-profit firms  charities or voluntary associations rather than the state 
in rothbardian anarcho-capitalism  law  the non-aggression principle  is enforced by the market but not created by it  while according to david d friedman s utilitarian version  the law itself is produced by the market 
while the term  anarcho-capitalism  was coined by rothbard and its origin is attributed to <!DIGIT!> united states  some historians  including rothbard himself  trace the school as far back as the mid-19th century to market theorists such as gustave de molinari 
anarcho-capitalism has drawn influence from pro-market theorists such as molinari  frdric bastiat  and robert nozick  as well as american individualist thinkers such as benjamin tucker and lysander spooner 
considered a form of individualist anarchism  it differs from the individualism of the  boston anarchists  of the <!DIGIT!> century in its rejection of the labor theory of value  and its normative implications  in favor of the neoclassical or austrian school marginalist view 
anarcho-capitalist ideas have in turn contributed to the development of agorism  autarchism  and crypto-anarchism 
anarcha-feminism 
anarcha-feminism is a synthesis of radical feminism and anarchism that views patriarchy  male domination over women  as a fundamental manifestation of involuntary hierarchy  to which anarchists are opposed 
anarcha-feminism was inspired in the late <!DIGIT!> century by the writings of early feminist anarchists such as lucy parsons  emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre 
anarcha-feminists  like other radical feminists  criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family  education and gender roles 
many anarcha-feminists are especially critical of marriage 
for instance  emma goldman has argued that marriage is a purely economic arrangement and that  woman pays for it with her name  her privacy  her self-respect  her very life 
anarcha-feminists view patriarchy as a fundamental problem in society and believe that the feminist struggle against sexism and patriarchy is an essential component of the anarchist struggle against the state and capitalism 
susan brown expressed the sentiment that  as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power  it is inherently feminist 
there have been several male anarcha-feminists  such as the anarcho-communist joseph djacque who opposed proudhon s anti-feminist views 
green anarchism 
green anarchism is an anarchist school of thought which places an emphasis on environmental issues 
sometimes  green anarchism is said to be techno-positive or techno-negative to differentiate between those who advocate use of advanced green technology to create and maintain an anarchist society and those who mainly see civilization and modern technology as something negative 
anarcho-primitivism is a form of green anarchism that believes agriculture and division of labour inevitably lead to inequality and are incompatible with anarchism and in effect must be abolished 
anarcho-primitivists often criticize traditional anarchism for supporting civilization and modern technology which they believe are inherently based on domination and exploitation 
they instead advocate the process of rewilding or reconnecting with the natural environment 
non-primitivist green anarchists  such as anthropologist brian morris  often draw influence from the social ecology of murray bookchin 
as a social movement 
anarchism as a social movement has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity 
its classical period  which scholars demarcate as from <!DIGIT!> to <!DIGIT!>  is associated with the working-class movements of the nineteenth century and the spanish civil war-era struggles against fascism 
the first international 
in europe  harsh reaction followed the revolutions of <!DIGIT!>  wherein ten countries experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist revolutions 
after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure  conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists  anarchists  liberals  and nationalists  to prevent further revolt 
in <!DIGIT!> the international workingmen s association  sometimes called the  first international   united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon  blanquists  philadelphes  english trade unionists  socialists and social democrats 
due to its links to active workers  movements  the international became a significant organization 
karl marx became a leading figure in the international and a member of its general council 
proudhon s followers  the mutualists  opposed marx s state socialism  advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings 
in <!DIGIT!>  following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom  lpf   mikhail bakunin and his associates joined the first international  which had decided not to get involved with the lpf 
they allied themselves with the anti-authoritarian socialist sections of the international  who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property 
at first  the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in a more revolutionary socialist direction 
subsequently  the international became polarized into two camps  with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads 
bakunin characterised marx s ideas as authoritarian and predicted that  if a marxist party came to power  its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against 
in <!DIGIT!>  the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the hague congress  where bakunin and james guillaume were expelled from the international and its headquarters were transferred to new york 
in response  the anti-authoritarian sections formed their own international at the st imier congress  adopting a revolutionary anarchist program 
organized labor 
the anti-authoritarian sections of the first international were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists  seeking to  replace the privilege and authority of the state  with the  free and spontaneous organization of labor 
in <!DIGIT!>  the federation of organized trades and labor unions  fotlu  of the united states and canada unanimously set <!DIGIT!> may <!DIGIT!>  as the date by which the eight-hour work day would become standard 
in response  unions across america prepared a general strike in support of the event 
upon <!DIGIT!> may  in chicago  a fight broke out when replacement workers attempted to cross the picket line 
police intervention led to the deaths of four men  enraging the workers of the city 
the next day  <!DIGIT!> may  anarchists staged a rally at chicago s haymarket square 
a bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally  killing an officer 
in the ensuing panic  police opened fire on the crowd and each other 
seven police officers and at least four workers were killed 
eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organizers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer 
the men became international political celebrities among the labor movement 
four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution 
the incident became known as the haymarket affair  and was a setback for the labor movement and the struggle for the eight hour day 
in <!DIGIT!> a second attempt  this time international in scope  to organize for the eight hour day was made 
the event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the haymarket affair 
the celebration of international workers  day on may day became an annual event the following year 
in <!DIGIT!>  the international anarchist congress of amsterdam gathered delegates from <!DIGIT!> different countries  among which important figures of the anarchist movement  including errico malatesta  pierre monatte  luigi fabbri  benot broutchoux  emma goldman  rudolf rocker  christiaan cornelissen  etc various themes were treated during the congress  in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement  popular education issues  the general strike or antimilitarism 
a central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism  or trade unionism  
malatesta and monatte in particular opposed themselves on this issue  as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution  while malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient 
malatesta thought that trade-unions were reformist  and could even be  at times  conservative 
along with cornelissen  he cited as example us trade-unions  where trade-unions composed of qualified workers sometimes opposed themselves to non-qualified workers in order to defend their relatively privileged position 
the spanish workers federation in <!DIGIT!> was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement  anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in spain 
the most successful was the confederacin nacional del trabajo  national confederation of labour  cnt   founded in <!DIGIT!> before the <!DIGIT!>  the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics and played a major role in the spanish civil war 
the cnt was affiliated with the international workers association  a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in <!DIGIT!>  with delegates representing two million workers from <!DIGIT!> countries in europe and latin america 
the largest organised anarchist movement today is in spain  in the form of the confederacin general del trabajo  cgt  and the cnt 
cgt membership was estimated to be around <!DIGIT!> for the year <!DIGIT!> other active syndicalist movements include the us workers solidarity alliance and the uk solidarity federation 
the revolutionary industrial unionist industrial workers of the world  claiming <!DIGIT!> paying members  and the international workers association  an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the first international  also remain active 
russian revolution 
anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions  many anarchists initially supporting the bolshevik coup 
however  the bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition  a conflict that culminated in the <!DIGIT!> kronstadt rebellion 
anarchists in central russia were either imprisoned  driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks 
in the ukraine  anarchists fought in the civil war against whites and then the bolsheviks as part of the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine led by nestor makhno  who attempted to establish an anarchist society in the region for a number of months 
expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman were amongst those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising  before they left russia 
both wrote accounts of their experiences in russia  criticizing the amount of control the bolsheviks exercised 
for them  bakunin s predictions about the consequences of marxist rule that the rulers of the new  socialist marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true 
the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally 
many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example  communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements 
in france and the us  for example  certain members of the major syndicalist movements of the cgt and iww left the organizations and joined the communist international 
in paris  the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles  which included nestor makhno  concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism 
their <!DIGIT!> manifesto  called the  organizational platform of the general union of anarchists  draft    was supported 
platformist groups active today include the workers solidarity movement in ireland and the north eastern federation of anarchist communists of north america 
fight against fascism 
in the <!DIGIT!> and <!DIGIT!>  the rise of fascism in europe transformed anarchism s conflict with the state 
italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists 
italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation  arditi del popolo   which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and marked up numerous successful victories  including repelling blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of parma in august <!DIGIT!> in france  where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the february <!DIGIT!> riots  anarchists divided over a united front policy 
in spain  the cnt initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance  and abstention by cnt supporters led to a right wing election victory 
but in <!DIGIT!>  the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power 
months later  the ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the spanish civil war  <!DIGIT!>  
in response to the army rebellion  an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers  supported by armed militias  took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivized the land 
but even before the fascist victory in <!DIGIT!>  the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the stalinists  who controlled the distribution of military aid to the republican cause from the soviet union 
according to george orwell and other foreign observers  stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident marxists and anarchists 
internal issues and debates 
anarchism is a philosophy which embodies many diverse attitudes  tendencies and schools of thought  as such  disagreement over questions of values  ideology and tactics is common 
the compatibility of capitalism  which anarchists usually reject  according to the  oxford companion to philosophy    nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed 
similarly  anarchism enjoys a complex relationship with ideologies such as marxism  communism and capitalism 
anarchists may be motivated by humanism  divine authority  enlightened self-interest or any number of alternative ethical doctrines 
phenomena such as civilization  technology  e g within anarcho-primitivism and insurrectionary anarchism   and the democratic process may be sharply criticized within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others 
anarchist attitudes towards race  gender and the environment have changed significantly since the modern origin of the philosophy in the <!DIGIT!> century 
on a tactical level  while propaganda of the deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the <!DIGIT!> century  e g the nihilist movement   contemporary anarchists espouse alternative methods such as nonviolence  counter-economics and anti-state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society 
the diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions  which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory 
autism 
autism is a brain development disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication  and by restricted and repetitive behavior 
these signs all begin before a child is three years old 
the autism spectrum disorders  asd  also include related conditions with milder signs and symptoms 
autism has a strong genetic basis  although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by multigene interactions or by rare mutations 
in rare cases  autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects 
other proposed causes  such as childhood vaccines  are controversial  and the vaccine hypotheses lack any convincing scientific evidence 
the prevalence of asd is about <!DIGIT!> per <!DIGIT!> people  with about four times as many boys as girls 
the number of people known to have autism has increased dramatically since the <!DIGIT!>  partly due to changes in diagnostic practice  the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved 
autism affects many parts of the brain  how this occurs is not understood 
parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child s life 
although early behavioral or cognitive intervention can help children gain self-care  social  and communication skills  there is no known cure 
few children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood  but some become successful  and an autistic culture has developed  with some seeking a cure and others believing that autism is a condition rather than a disorder 
characteristics 
autism is a highly variable brain development disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood  and generally follows a steady course without remission 
symptoms tend to continue through adulthood  although often in more muted form 
it is distinguished not by a single symptom  but by a characteristic triad of symptoms  impairments in social interaction  impairments in communication  and restricted interests and repetitive behavior 
other aspects  such as atypical eating  are also common but are not essential for diagnosis 
autism is one of three related autism spectrum disorders  asd  see  classification   
its individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly  without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits 
social development 
social deficits distinguish asd from other developmental disorders 
people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted 
noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals  or people with normal neural development  as leaving her feeling  like an anthropologist on mars  
social impairments become apparent early in childhood 
autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli  smile and look at others less often  and respond less to their own name 
autistic toddlers have more striking social deviance  for example  they have less eye contact and anticipatory postures and are more likely to communicate by manipulating another person s hand 
three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding  approach others spontaneously  imitate and respond to emotions  communicate nonverbally  and take turns with others 
however  they do form attachments to their primary caregivers 
they display moderately less attachment security than usual  although this feature disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe asd 
older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition 
contrary to common belief  autistic children do not prefer to be alone 
making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism 
for them  the quality of friendships  not the number of friends  predicts how lonely they feel 
there are many anecdotal reports  but few systematic studies  of aggression and violence in individuals with asd 
the limited data suggest that  in children with mental retardation  autism is associated with aggression  destruction of property  and tantrums 
a <!DIGIT!> study interviewed parents of <!DIGIT!> children with asd and reported that about two-thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one-third had a history of aggression  with tantrums significantly more common than in children with a history of language impairment 
a <!DIGIT!> swedish study found that  of individuals aged <!DIGIT!> or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of asd  those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as psychosis 
communication 
about a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs 
differences in communication may be present from the first year of life  and may include delayed onset of babbling  unusual gestures  diminished responsiveness  and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver 
in the second and third years  autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling  consonants  words  and word combinations  their gestures are less often integrated with words 
autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences  and are more likely to simply repeat others  words  echolalia  or reverse pronouns 
joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech  and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd  for example  they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object  and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience 
autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language 
in a pair of studies  high-functioning autistic children aged <!DIGIT!> performed equally well  and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling 
both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language  comprehension and inference 
as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills  these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends 
repetitive behavior 
autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior  which the repetitive behavior scale-revised  rbs-r  categorizes as follows 
no single repetitive behavior seems to be specific to autism  but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors 
other symptoms 
autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis  but that can affect the individual or the family 
an estimated <!DIGIT!> % to <!DIGIT!> % of individuals with asd show unusual abilities  ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants 
unusual responses to sensory stimuli are more common and prominent in autistic children  although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders 
differences are greater for under-responsivity  for example  walking into things  than for over-responsivity  for example  distress from loud noises  or for seeking  for example  rhythmic movements  
several studies have reported associated motor problems that include poor muscle tone  poor motor planning  and toe walking  asd is not associated with severe motor disturbances 
unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with asd  to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator 
selectivity is the most common problem  although eating rituals and food refusal also occur  this does not appear to result in malnutrition 
although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal  gi  symptoms  there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different gi symptoms than usual  studies report conflicting results  and the relationship between gi problems and asd is unclear 
sleep problems are known to be more common in children with developmental disabilities  and there is some evidence that children with asd are more likely to have even more sleep problems than those with other developmental disabilities  autistic children may experience problems including difficulty in falling asleep  frequent nocturnal awakenings  and early morning awakenings 
a <!DIGIT!> study reported that about two-thirds of children with asd have a history of sleep problems 
parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress 
siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling  siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults 
classification 
autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders  pdd   which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication  and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior 
these symptoms do not imply sickness  fragility  or emotional disturbance 
of the five pdd forms  asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes  rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism  but may have unrelated causes  pdd not otherwise specified  pdd-nos  also called  atypical autism   is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder 
unlike autism  asperger s has no substantial delay in language development 
the terminology of autism can be bewildering  with autism  asperger s and pdd-nos often called the  autism spectrum disorders   asd  or sometimes the  autistic disorders   whereas autism itself is often called  autistic disorder    childhood autism   or  infantile autism  
in this article   autism  refers to the classic autistic disorder  in clinical practice  though   autism    asd   and  pdd  are often used interchangeably 
asd  in turn  is a subset of the broader autism phenotype  bap   which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autistic-like traits  such as avoiding eye contact 
the manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum  ranging from individuals with severe impairments - who may be silent  mentally disabled  and locked into hand flapping and rocking - to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches  narrowly focused interests  and verbose  pedantic communication 
sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-  medium- and high-functioning autism  lfa  mfa  and hfa   based on iq thresholds  or on how much support the individual requires in daily life  these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial 
autism can also be divided into syndromal and non-syndromal autism  where the former is associated with severe or profound mental retardation or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms  such as tuberous sclerosis 
although individuals with asperger s tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism  the extent of the overlap between asperger s  hfa  and non-syndromal autism is unclear 
some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills  as opposed to a failure to make progress  typically from <!DIGIT!> to <!DIGIT!> months of age 
the validity of this distinction remains controversial  it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype 
research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subpopulations and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry  psychology  neurology and pediatrics 
it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior  with the name  type <!DIGIT!> autism  denoting rare autism cases that test positive for a mutation in the cntnap2 gene 
causes 
it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic  cognitive  and neural levels for autism s characteristic triad of symptoms 
however  there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur 
autism has a strong genetic basis  although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by multigene interactions or by rare mutations with major effects 
complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes  the environment  and epigenetic factors which do not change dna but are heritable and influence gene expression 
early studies of twins estimated heritability explains more than <!DIGIT!> % of the risk of autism  assuming a shared environment and no other genetic or medical syndromes 
however  most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified 
typically  autism cannot be traced to a mendelian  single-gene  mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality like angelman syndrome or fragile x syndrome  and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds has been shown to selectively cause asd 
numerous candidate genes have been located  with only small effects attributable to any particular gene 
the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from copy number variations - spontaneous deletions or duplications in genetic material during meiosis 
hence  a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited  that is  the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome 
gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes  and that the symptoms may be reversed or reduced by replacing or modulating gene function after birth 
all known teratogens  agents that cause birth defects  related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception  and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later  it is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development 
although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies  extensive searches are underway 
environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism  or may be important in future research  include certain foods  infectious disease  heavy metals  solvents  diesel exhaust  pcbs  phthalates and phenols used in plastic products  pesticides  brominated flame retardants  alcohol  smoking  illicit drugs  vaccines  and prenatal stress 
although parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination  and parental concern about vaccines has led to a decreasing uptake of childhood immunizations and an increasing likelihood of measles outbreaks   the overwhelming majority of scientific studies show no causal association between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism  and there is no convincing scientific evidence showing that the vaccine preservative thiomersal helps cause autism 
mechanism 
autism s symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain 
despite extensive investigation  how autism occurs is not well understood 
its mechanism can be divided into two areas  the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism  and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors 
the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies 
pathophysiology 
unlike many other brain disorders such as parkinson s  autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular  cellular  or systems level  it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways  or is  like intellectual disability  a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms 
autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems  and to disturb the course of brain development more than the final product 
neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism s mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception 
this localized anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors 
although many major structures of the human brain have been implicated  almost all postmortem studies have been of individuals who also had mental retardation  making it difficult to draw conclusions 
brain weight and volume and head circumference tend to be greater in autistic children 
the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth are not known  nor is it known whether the overgrown neural systems cause autism s characteristic signs 
current hypotheses include  interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life  and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response 
several symptoms consistent with a poorly regulated immune response have been reported in autistic children 
it is possible that aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is part of the mechanism of some forms of asd 
as autoantibodies have not been associated with pathology  are found in diseases other than asd  and are not always present in asd  the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial 
several neurotransmitter abnormalities have been detected in autism  notably increased blood levels of serotonin 
whether these lead to structural or behavioral abnormalities is unclear 
some data suggest an increase in several growth hormones  other data argue for diminished growth factors 
also  some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism but probably account for less than <!DIGIT!> % of cases 
the mirror neuron system  mns  theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the mns interferes with imitation and leads to autism s core features of social impairment and communication difficulties 
the mns operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal of the same species perform the same action 
the mns may contribute to an individual s understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions  intentions  and emotions 
several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in mns regions of individuals with asd  delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with asperger s  and a correlation between reduced mns activity and severity of the syndrome in children with asd 
however  individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the mns and the mns theory does not explain the normal performance of autistic children on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object 
asd-related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks 
in autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network  a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing  with intact connectivity of the task-positive network  used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking 
the two networks are not negatively correlated in people with autism  suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks  possibly reflecting a disturbance of self-referential thought 
a <!DIGIT!> brain-imaging study found a specific pattern of signals in the cingulate cortex which differs in individuals with asd 
the underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization  along with an excess of low-level processes 
evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brain wave study that suggested that adults with asd have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex 
other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex 
from studies based on event-related potentials  transient changes to the brain s electrical activity in response to stimuli  there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention  orientiation to auditory and visual stimuli  novelty detection  language and face processing  and information storage  several studies have found a preference for non-social stimuli 
for example  magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brain s processing of auditory signals 
neuropsychology 
two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior 
the first category focuses on deficits in social cognition 
hyper-systemizing hypothesizes that autistic individuals can systematize - that is  they can develop internal rules of operation to handle internal events - but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents 
it extends the extreme male brain theory  which hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain  defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing 
this in turn is related to the earlier theory of mind  which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others 
the theory of mind is supported by autistic children s atypical responses to the sally-anne test for reasoning about others  motivations  and is mapped well from the mirror neuron system theory of autism 
the second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing 
executive dysfunction hypothesizes that autistic behavior results in part from deficits in working memory  planning  inhibition  and other forms of executive function 
tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence  but performance never reaches typical adult levels 
a strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests  two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children 
weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism 
one strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people 
a related theory - enhanced perceptual functioning - focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals 
these theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism 
neither category is satisfactory on its own  social cognition theories poorly address autism s rigid and repetitive behaviors  while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties 
a combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful 
screening 
about half of parents of children with asd notice their child s unusual behaviors by age <!DIGIT!> months  and about four-fifths notice by age <!DIGIT!> months 
as postponing treatment may affect long-term outcome  any of the following signs is reason to have a child evaluated by a specialist without delay  the american academy of pediatrics recommends that all children be screened for asd at the <!DIGIT!> and <!DIGIT!> well-child doctor visits  using autism-specific formal screening tests 
in contrast  the uk national screening committee recommends against screening for asd in the general population  because screening tools have not been fully validated and interventions lack sufficient evidence for effectiveness 
screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers  m-chat   the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire  and the first year inventory  initial data on m-chat and its predecessor chat on children aged <!DIGIT!> months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity  many false-negatives  but good specificity  few false-positives  
it may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders 
screening tools designed for one culture s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture 
genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical 
diagnosis 
diagnosis is based on behavior  not cause or mechanism 
autism is defined in the dsm-iv-tr as exhibiting at least six symptoms total  including at least two symptoms of qualitative impairment in social interaction  at least one symptom of qualitative impairment in communication  and at least one symptom of restricted and repetitive behavior 
sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity  stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language  and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects 
onset must be prior to age three years  with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction  language as used in social communication  or symbolic or imaginative play 
the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome or childhood disintegrative disorder 
icd-10 uses essentially the same definition 
several diagnostic instruments are available 
two are commonly used in autism research  the autism diagnostic interview-revised  adi-r  is a semistructured parent interview  and the autism diagnostic observation schedule  ados  uses observation and interaction with the child 
the childhood autism rating scale  cars  is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children 
a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child 
if warranted  diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists  observing and assessing cognitive  communication  family  and other factors using standardized tools  and taking into account any associated medical conditions 
a pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills  both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions 
a differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider mental retardation  hearing impairment  and a specific language impairment such as landau-kleffner syndrome 
clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed  particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause 
although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated <!DIGIT!> % of cases to genetic causes  consensus guidelines in the u s and uk are limited to high-resolution chromosome and fragile x testing 
a genotype-first model of diagnosis has been proposed  which would routinely assess the genome s copy number variations 
as new genetic tests are developed several ethical  legal  and social issues will emerge 
commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results  given the complexity of autism s genetics 
metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful  but are not routine 
asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age <!DIGIT!> months  although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life  for example  a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later 
in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most <!DIGIT!> weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment  though few cases are handled that quickly in practice 
a <!DIGIT!> u s study found the average age of first evaluation by a qualified professional was <!DIGIT!> months and of formal asd diagnosis was <!DIGIT!> months  reflecting an average <!DIGIT!> delay  all far above recommendations 
although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood  they are sometimes missed  adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves  to help their employers make adjustments  or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits 
underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases  and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices 
the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd  resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms 
conversely  the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis 
it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired  partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision  and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes 
management 
the main goals of treatment are to lessen associated deficits and family distress  and to increase quality of life and functional independence 
no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child s needs 
studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy 
although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence  suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment  the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor  their clinical results are mostly tentative  and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options 
intensive  sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care  social  and job skills  and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors  claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated 
available approaches include applied behavior analysis  aba   developmental models  structured teaching  speech and language therapy  social skills therapy  and occupational therapy 
educational interventions have some effectiveness in children  intensive aba treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well-established for improving intellectual performance of young children 
neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators  resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided 
it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up  and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results 
many medications are used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails 
more than half of u s children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants  with the most common drug classes being antidepressants  stimulants  and antipsychotics 
aside from antipsychotics  there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd 
a person with asd may respond atypically to medications  the medications can have adverse effects  and no known medication relieves autism s core symptoms of social and communication impairments 
although many alternative therapies and interventions are available  few are supported by scientific studies 
treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality-of-life contexts  and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance 
scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing  training availability  and parent requests 
though most alternative treatments  such as melatonin  have only mild adverse effects some may place the child at risk 
a <!DIGIT!> study found that compared to their peers  autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein-free diets  in <!DIGIT!>  botched chelation therapy killed a five-year-old child with autism 
treatment is expensive  indirect costs are more so 
a u s study estimated an average cost of $32 million in <!DIGIT!> u s dollars for someone born in <!DIGIT!>  with about <!DIGIT!> % medical care  <!DIGIT!> % extra education and other care  and <!DIGIT!> % lost economic productivity 
publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child  and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems  one <!DIGIT!> u s study found a <!DIGIT!> % average loss of annual income in families of children with asd  and a related study found that asd is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment 
after childhood  key treatment issues include residential care  job training and placement  sexuality  social skills  and estate planning 
prognosis 
there is no known cure 
children recover occasionally  so that they lose their diagnosis of asd  this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not 
it is not known how often recovery happens  reported rates in unselected samples of children with asd have ranged from <!DIGIT!> % to <!DIGIT!> % 
most children with autism lack social support  meaningful relationships  future employment opportunities or self-determination 
although core difficulties tend to persist  symptoms often become less severe with age 
few high-quality studies address long-term prognosis 
some adults show modest improvement in communication skills  but a few decline  no study has focused on autism after midlife 
acquiring language before age six  having an iq above <!DIGIT!>  and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes  independent living is unlikely with severe autism 
a <!DIGIT!> british study of <!DIGIT!> adults who were diagnosed before <!DIGIT!> as autistic children with iq above <!DIGIT!> found that <!DIGIT!> % achieved a high level of independence as adults  <!DIGIT!> % had some friends and were generally in work but required some support  <!DIGIT!> % had some independence but were generally living at home and needed considerable support and supervision in daily living  <!DIGIT!> % needed specialist residential provision from facilities specializing in asd with a high level of support and very limited autonomy  and <!DIGIT!> % needed high-level hospital care 
a <!DIGIT!> swedish study of <!DIGIT!> adults that did not exclude low iq found worse prognosis  for example  only <!DIGIT!> % achieved independence 
a <!DIGIT!> canadian study of <!DIGIT!> young adults diagnosed with asd as preschoolers found outcomes ranging through poor  <!DIGIT!> %   fair  <!DIGIT!> %   good  <!DIGIT!> %   and very good  <!DIGIT!> %   <!DIGIT!> % of these young adults had been employed at some point during their lives  mostly in volunteer  sheltered or part time work 
changes in diagnostic practice and increased availability of effective early intervention make it unclear whether these findings can be generalized to recently diagnosed children 
epidemiology 
most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of <!DIGIT!> per <!DIGIT!> for autism and close to <!DIGIT!> per <!DIGIT!> for asd  because of inadequate data  these numbers may underestimate asd s true prevalence 
pdd-nos s prevalence has been estimated at <!DIGIT!> per <!DIGIT!>  asperger s at roughly <!DIGIT!> per <!DIGIT!>  and childhood disintegrative disorder at <!DIGIT!> per <!DIGIT!> 
the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the <!DIGIT!> and early <!DIGIT!> 
this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices  referral patterns  availability of services  age at diagnosis  and public awareness  though unidentified contributing environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out 
the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism s true prevalence has increased  a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics 
boys are at higher risk for asd than girls 
the sex ratio averages <!DIGIT!> and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment  it may be close to <!DIGIT!> with mental retardation and more than <!DIGIT!> without 
the risk of autism is also associated with several prenatal and perinatal risk factors 
a <!DIGIT!> review of risk factors found associated parental characteristics that included advanced maternal age  advanced paternal age  and maternal place of birth outside europe or north america  and also found associated obstetric conditions that included low birth weight and gestation duration  and hypoxia during childbirth 
most professionals believe that race  ethnicity  and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism 
autism is associated with several other conditions  history 
a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named 
the  table talk  of martin luther contains the story of a <!DIGIT!> boy who may have been severely autistic 
according to luther s notetaker mathesius  luther thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil  and suggested that he be suffocated 
the wild boy of aveyron  a feral child caught in <!DIGIT!>  showed several signs of autism  the medical student jean itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation 
the new latin word  autismus   english translation  autism   was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in <!DIGIT!> as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia 
he derived it from the greek word  autos     meaning  self    and used it to mean morbid self-admiration  referring to  autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies  against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance  
the word  autism  first took its modern sense in <!DIGIT!> when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler s terminology  autistic psychopaths  in a lecture in german about child psychology 
asperger was investigating a form of asd now known as asperger syndrome  though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until <!DIGIT!> leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used  autism  in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label  early infantile autism  in a <!DIGIT!> report of <!DIGIT!> children with striking behavioral similarities 
almost all the characteristics described in kanner s first paper on the subject  notably  autistic aloneness  and  insistence on sameness   are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders 
it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger 
kanner s reuse of  autism  led to decades of confused terminology like  infantile schizophrenia   and child psychiatry s focus on maternal deprivation during the mid-1900s led to misconceptions of autism as an infant s response to  refrigerator mothers  
starting in the late <!DIGIT!> autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong  distinguishing it from mental retardation and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders  and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy 
as late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism  now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions 
although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have deeply affected how we view asd  parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their autistic children s behaviors are perceived negatively by others  and many primary care physicians and medical specialists still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research 
the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with  and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely 
sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed  some in the community seek a cure  while others believe that autism is simply another way of being 
albedo 
the albedo of an object is the extent to which it diffusely reflects light from the sun 
it is therefore a more specific form of the term reflectivity 
albedo is defined as the ratio of diffusely reflected to incident electromagnetic radiation 
it is a unitless measure indicative of a surface s or body s diffuse reflectivity 
the word is derived from latin  albedo   whiteness   in turn from  albus   white  
the range of possible values is from <!DIGIT!>  dark  to <!DIGIT!>  bright  
the albedo is an important concept in climatology and astronomy 
in climatology it is sometimes expressed as a percentage 
its value depends on the frequency of radiation considered  unqualified  it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light 
in general  the albedo depends on the direction and directional distribution of incoming radiation 
exceptions are lambertian surfaces  which scatter radiation in all directions in a cosine function  so their albedo does not depend on the incoming distribution 
in realistic cases  a bidirectional reflectance distribution function  brdf  is required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately  although albedos are a very useful first approximation 
terrestrial albedo 
albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to <!DIGIT!> % for fresh snow  to about <!DIGIT!> % for charcoal  one of the darkest substances 
deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a blackbody 
when seen from a distance  the ocean surface has a low albedo  as do most forests  while desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms 
most land areas are in an albedo range of <!DIGIT!> to <!DIGIT!> 
the average albedo of the earth is about <!DIGIT!> % 
this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds 
human activities have changed the albedo  via forest clearance and farming  for example  of various areas around the globe 
however  quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult 
the classic example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback 
if a snow-covered area warms and the snow melts  the albedo decreases  more sunlight is absorbed  and the temperature tends to increase 
the converse is true  if snow forms  a cooling cycle happens 
the intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation  for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics 
the earth s surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasa s modis instruments onboard the terra and aqua satellites 
as the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite  a mathematical model of the brdf is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional-hemispherical reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance 
white-sky and black-sky albedo 
it has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo  the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms  the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle   and the bi-hemispherical reflectance  the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination 
albedo can then be given as  directional-hemispherical reflectance is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and bi-hemispherical reflectance as white sky albedo 
these terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface 
astronomical albedo 
the albedo of planets  satellites and asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties 
the study of albedos  their dependence on wavelength  lighting angle   phase angle    and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry 
for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes  much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos 
for example  the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects  the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties  while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in asteroids 
enceladus  a moon of saturn  has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system  with <!DIGIT!> % of em radiation reflected 
another notable high albedo body is eris  with an albedo of <!DIGIT!> % 
many objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about <!DIGIT!> % 
a typical comet nucleus has an albedo of <!DIGIT!> 
such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds 
the overall albedo of the moon is around <!DIGIT!> %  but it is strongly directional and non-lambertian  displaying also a strong opposition effect 
while such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains  they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies 
two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the  v-band  geometric albedo  measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer  and the bond albedo  measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected  
their values can differ significantly  which is a common source of confusion 
in detailed studies  the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle  including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces 
the correlation between astronomical  geometric  albedo  absolute magnitude and diameter is  where is astronomical albedo  is diameter in kilometres  and  h  is the absolute magnitude 
other types of albedo 
single scattering albedo - is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles 
it depends on properties of the material  refractive index   the size of the particles   and the wavelength of the incoming radiation 
the tropics 
although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of earth  because more snow falls there  it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight 
when ranchers cut down dark  tropical rainforest trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops  the average temperature of the area increases up to <!DIGIT!> c  <!DIGIT!> f  year-round  although part of the effect is due to changed evaporation  latent heat flux  
small scale effects 
albedo works on a smaller scale  too 
people who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than those who wear lighter color clothes 
trees 
because trees tend to have a low albedo  removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby could produce localized climate cooling 
cloud feedbacks further complicate the issue 
in seasonally snow-covered zones  winter albedos of treeless areas are <!DIGIT!> % to <!DIGIT!> % higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily 
deciduous trees have an albedo value of about <!DIGIT!> to <!DIGIT!> while coniferous trees have a value of about <!DIGIT!> to <!DIGIT!> 
the difference between deciduous and coniferous is because coniferous trees are darker in general and have cone-shaped crowns 
the shape of these crowns trap radiant energy more effectively than deciduous trees 
studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative  generally warming  effect of albedo change and  cooling  effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests 
they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool  new forests in high latitudes  e g siberia  were neutral or perhaps warming 
snow 
snow albedos can be as high as <!DIGIT!> %  this  however  is for the ideal example  fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape 
over antarctica they average a little more than <!DIGIT!> % 
if a marginally snow-covered area warms  snow tends to melt  lowering the albedo  and hence leading to more snowmelt  the ice-albedo positive feedback  
water 
water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials 
the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations  see graph  
at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a specular manner  not diffusely  
the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this 
at small angles of incident light  waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs 
-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle 
although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light  it increases tremendously at high angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the earth near the terminator  early morning  late afternoon and near the poles  
however  as mentioned above  waviness causes an appreciable reduction 
since the light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer  water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light 
note that white caps on waves look white  and have high albedo  because the water is foamed up  not smooth at the scale of the wavelength of light  so the fresnel equations do not apply 
fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection 
clouds 
clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation 
different types of clouds have different albedo values  theoretically ranging from a minimum of near <!DIGIT!> % to a maximum in the high <!DIGIT!> 
on any given day  about half of earth is covered by clouds  which reflect more sunlight than land and water 
clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight  but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth 
albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds  such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic 
a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields by saddam hussein showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as <!DIGIT!> colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies 
aerosol effects 
aerosol  very fine particles/ droplets in the atmosphere  has two effects  direct and indirect 
the direct  albedo  effect is generally to cool the planet  the indirect effect  the particles act as ccns and thereby change cloud properties  is less certain 
aerosols can modify the earths radiative balance through the aerosol direct and indirect  - aerosol direct effect 
aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation 
the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling  whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming 
- aerosol indirect effect 
aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei  ccn  
increased ccn concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations  cdnc  
a greater number of cloud droplets leads to increased cloud albedo  increased light scattering and radiative cooling  first indirect effect  
increased cdnc also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud  second indirect effect  
black carbon 
another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles 
the size of this effect is difficult to quantify  the ipcc say that their  estimate of the global mean radiative forcing for bc aerosols from fossil fuels is  <!DIGIT!> w m-2  from <!DIGIT!> w m-2 in the sar  with a range <!DIGIT!> to <!DIGIT!> w m  -2  
a the letter a is the first letter in the latin alphabet 
its name in english is  a    the plural is  aes  or  more commonly  a s 
history 
the letter a can be traced to a pictogram of an ox head in egyptian hieroglyphs or the proto-sinaitic alphabet 
circa <!DIGIT!> b c the phoenician alphabet s letter had a linear form that served as the basis for some later forms 
its name must have corresponded closely to the hebrew aleph 
when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet  they had no use for the glottal stop that the letter had denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages  so they used the sign for the vowel  and kept its name with a minor change  alpha  
in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages  dating to the <!DIGIT!> century bc  the letter rests upon its side  but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter  although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg  or by the angle at which the cross line is set 
the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged 
the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write latin  and the resulting letter was preserved in the modern latin alphabet used to write many languages  including english 
the letter has two minuscule  lower-case  forms 
the form used in most current handwriting  and in italic type  consists of a circle and vertical stroke    called latin alpha or  script a  
most printed material uses a form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it   
both derive from the majuscule  capital  form 
in greek handwriting  it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop  as demonstrated by the uncial version shown 
many fonts then made the right leg vertical 
in some of these  the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc  resulting in the printed form  while in others it was dropped  resulting in the modern handwritten form 
usage 
in english  the letter  a  by itself usually denotes the near-open front unrounded vowel   as in  pad   the open back unrounded vowel   as in  father   or  in concert with a later orthographic vowel  the diphthong  though the pronunciation varies with the dialect  as in  ace  and  major   due to effects of the great vowel shift 
in most other languages that use the latin alphabet  the letter a denotes either an open back unrounded vowel    or an open central unrounded vowel   
in the international phonetic alphabet  variants of the letter a denote various vowels 
in x-sampa  capital a denotes the open back unrounded vowel and lowercase a denotes the open front unrounded vowel 
a  is the third-most-common letter in english  and the second-most-common in spanish and french 
on average  about <!DIGIT!> % of letters in english tend to be  as  while the number is <!DIGIT!> % in spanish and <!DIGIT!> % in french 
codes for computing 
in unicode the capital a is codepoint u0041 and the lower case a is u0061 
the ascii code for capital a is <!DIGIT!> and for lower case a is <!DIGIT!>  or in binary <!DIGIT!> and <!DIGIT!>  respectively 
the ebcdic code for capital a is <!DIGIT!> and for lowercase a is <!DIGIT!> the numeric character references in html and xml are  &amp  #65   and  &amp  #97   for upper and lower case  respectively 
alabama 
alabama  formally  the  state of alabama    the <!DIGIT!> state  is a state located in the southern region of the united states of america 
it is bordered by tennessee to the north  georgia to the east  florida and the gulf of mexico to the south  and mississippi to the west 
alabama ranks <!DIGIT!> in total land area and ranks second in the size of its inland waterways 
the state ranks <!DIGIT!> in population with almost <!DIGIT!> residents in <!DIGIT!> from the american civil war until world war ii  alabama  like many southern states  suffered economic hardship  in part because of continued dependence on agriculture 
white rural interests dominated the state legislature until the <!DIGIT!>  while urban interests and african americans were underrepresented 
in the years following world war ii  alabama experienced significant recovery as the economy of the state transitioned from agriculture to diversified interests in heavy manufacturing  mineral extraction  education  and high technology  as well as the establishment or expansion of multiple military installations  primarily those of the u s army and u s air force 
today  the state is heavily invested in aerospace  education  health care  and banking  and various heavy industries including automobile manufacturing  mineral extraction  steel production and fabrication 
alabama is unofficially nicknamed the  yellowhammer state   which is also the name of the state bird 
alabama is also known as the  heart of dixie  
the state tree is the longleaf pine  the state flower is the camellia 
the capital of alabama is montgomery  and the largest city by population is birmingham 
the largest city by total land area is huntsville 
the oldest city is mobile 
etymology of state name 
the alabama  a muskogean tribe  which resided just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the alabama river  served as the etymological source of the names of the river and state 
in the alabama language  the word for an alabama person is  albaamo   or variously  albaama  or  albamo  in different dialects  the plural form  alabama persons  is  albaamaha   
the word  alabama  is believed to have originated from the choctaw language and was later adopted by the alabama tribe as their name 
the spelling of the word varies significantly between sources 
the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of <!DIGIT!> with garcilasso de la vega using  alibamo  while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote  alibamu  and  limamu   respectively 
as early as <!DIGIT!>  the tribe was known to the french as  alibamon  with french maps identifying the river as  rivire des alibamons  
other spellings of the appellation have included  alibamu    alabamo    albama    alebamon    alibama    alibamou    alabamu   and  allibamou  
although the origin of  alabama  was evident  the meaning of the tribe s name was not always clear 
an article without a byline appearing in the  jacksonville republican  on july <!DIGIT!>  <!DIGIT!> originated the idea that the meaning was  here we rest 
this notion was popularized in the <!DIGIT!> through the writings of alexander beaufort meek 
experts in the muskogean languages have been unable to find any evidence that would support this translation 
it is now generally accepted that the word comes from the choctaw words  alba   meaning  plants  or  weeds   and  amo   meaning  to cut    to trim   or  to gather   
this results in translations such as  clearers of the thicket  or even  herb gatherers  which may refer to clearing of land for the purpose of planting crops or to collection of medicinal plants by medicine men 
history 
among the native american people once living in the area of present day alabama were alabama  alibamu   cherokee  chickasaw  choctaw  creek  koasati  and mobile 
trade with the northeast via the ohio river began during the burial mound period  <!DIGIT!> bc-700 ad  and continued until european contact 
the agrarian mississippian culture covered most of the state from <!DIGIT!> to <!DIGIT!> ad  with one of its major centers being at the moundville archaeological site in moundville  alabama 
artifacts recovered from archaeological excavations at moundville were a major component in the formulation of the southeastern ceremonial complex 
contrary to popular belief  this development appears to have no direct links to mesoamerica  but developed independently 
this ceremonial complex represents a major component of the religion of the mississippian peoples  and is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood 
the french founded the first european settlement in the state with the establishment of mobile in <!DIGIT!> southern alabama was french from <!DIGIT!> to <!DIGIT!>  part of british west florida from <!DIGIT!> to <!DIGIT!>  and part of spanish west florida from <!DIGIT!> to <!DIGIT!> northern and central alabama was part of british georgia from <!DIGIT!> to <!DIGIT!> and part of the american mississippi territory thereafter 
its statehood was delayed by the lack of a coastline  rectified when andrew jackson captured spanish mobile in <!DIGIT!> alabama was the twenty-second state admitted to the union  in <!DIGIT!> alabama was the new frontier in the <!DIGIT!> and <!DIGIT!> 
settlers rapidly arrived to take advantage of fertile soils 
planters brought slaves with them  and traders brought in more from the upper south as the cotton plantations expanded 
the economy of the central  black belt  featured large cotton plantations whose owners built their wealth on the labor of enslaved african americans 
it was named for the dark  fertile soil 
elsewhere poor whites were subsistence farmers 
according to the <!DIGIT!> census  enslaved africans comprised <!DIGIT!> % of the state s population of <!DIGIT!> 
there were only <!DIGIT!> free persons of color 
in <!DIGIT!> alabama seceded from the union to join the confederate states of america 
while not many battles were fought in the state  alabama contributed about <!DIGIT!> soldiers to the civil war 
all the slaves were freed by <!DIGIT!> following reconstruction  alabama was readmitted to the union in <!DIGIT!> after the civil war  the state was still chiefly rural and tied to cotton 
planters resisted working with free labor and sought to re-establish controls over african americans 
whites used paramilitary groups  jim crow laws and segregation to reduce freedoms of african americans and restore their own dominance 
in its new constitution of <!DIGIT!>  the legislature effectively disenfranchised african americans through voting restrictions 
while the planter class had engaged poor whites in supporting these efforts  the new restrictions resulted in disenfranchising poor whites as well 
by <!DIGIT!>  a total of more whites than blacks had been disenfranchised  <!DIGIT!> whites to <!DIGIT!> blacks 
this was due mostly to effects of the cumulative poll tax 
the damage to the african-american community was more pervasive  as nearly all its citizens lost the ability to vote 
in <!DIGIT!>  fourteen black belt counties  which were primarily african american  had more than <!DIGIT!> voters on the rolls 
by june <!DIGIT!>  <!DIGIT!>  the number of registered voters had dropped to <!DIGIT!> 
in <!DIGIT!>  alabama had more than <!DIGIT!> african americans eligible to vote 
by <!DIGIT!>  only <!DIGIT!> had managed to  qualify  to register  although at least <!DIGIT!> black voters were literate 
the shut out was long-lasting 
the disenfranchisement was ended only by african americans leading the civil rights movement and gaining federal legislation in the mid-1960s to protect their voting and civil rights 
such legislation also protected the rights of poor whites 
the rural-dominated legislature continued to underfund schools and services for african americans in the segregated state  but did not relieve them of paying taxes 
continued racial discrimination  agricultural depression  and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans to seek out opportunities in northern cities 
they left alabama in the early <!DIGIT!> century as part of the great migration to industrial jobs and better futures in northern industrial cities 
the rate of population growth rate in alabama  see table  dropped by nearly half from <!DIGIT!>  reflecting the outmigration 
at the same time  many rural whites and blacks migrated to the city of birmingham for work in new industrial jobs 
it experienced such rapid growth that it was nicknamed  the magic city 
by the <!DIGIT!>  birmingham was the <!DIGIT!> largest city in the u s and held more than <!DIGIT!> % of the population of the state 
heavy industry and mining were the basis of the economy 
despite massive population changes in the state from <!DIGIT!> to <!DIGIT!>  the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population 
they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas 
in addition  the state legislature gerrymandered the few birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside of birmingham 
one result was that jefferson county  home of birmingham s industrial and economic powerhouse  contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state 
urban interests were consistently underrepresented 
a <!DIGIT!> study noted that because of rural domination   a minority of about <!DIGIT!> per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature 
because of the long disfranchisement of african americans  the state continued as one-party democratic for decades 
it produced a number of national leaders 
industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought prosperity 
cotton faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base 
in the <!DIGIT!> under governor george wallace  many whites in the state opposed integration efforts 
during the civil rights movement  african americans achieved a restoration of voting and other civil rights through the passage of the national civil rights act of <!DIGIT!>  and the voting rights act of <!DIGIT!>  de jure  segregation ended in the states as jim crow laws were invalidated or repealed 
under the voting rights act of <!DIGIT!>  cases were filed in federal courts to force alabama to properly redistrict by population both the state legislature house and senate 
in <!DIGIT!>  for the first time since <!DIGIT!>  the alabama constitution s provision for periodic redistricting based on population was implemented 
this benefited the many urban areas that had developed  and all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than <!DIGIT!> 
after <!DIGIT!>  the state s white voters shifted much of their support to republican candidates in presidential elections  as also occurred in neighboring southern states  
since <!DIGIT!> the majority of whites in the state have also voted increasingly republican in state elections 
geography 
alabama is the thirtieth largest state in the united states with <!DIGIT!> square miles  <!DIGIT!>  of total area  <!DIGIT!> % of the area is water  making alabama twenty-third in the amount of surface water  also giving it the second largest inland waterway system in the united states

the city of mobile  alabama s only saltwater port  is a busy seaport on the gulf of mexico with inland waterway access to the midwest via the tennessee-tombigbee waterway 
the port of mobile is the <!DIGIT!> largest by tonnage in the united states

taxes 
alabama s tax structure is one the most regressive in the united states 
alabama levies a <!DIGIT!>  <!DIGIT!>  or <!DIGIT!> percent personal income tax  depending upon the amount earned and filing status  though taxpayers can deduct their federal income tax from their alabama state tax  which favors wealthier alabamians who typically pay federal taxes 
the state s general sales tax rate is <!DIGIT!> % 
the collection rate could be substantially higher  depending upon additional city and county sales taxes 
for example  the total sales tax rate in mobile is <!DIGIT!> % and there is an additional restaurant tax of <!DIGIT!> %  which means that a diner in mobile would pay a <!DIGIT!> % tax on a meal 
sales and excise taxes in alabama account for <!DIGIT!> percent of all state and local revenue  compared with an average of about <!DIGIT!> percent nationwide 
alabama is also one of the few remaining states that levies a tax on food and medicine 
alabama s income tax on poor working families is among the nation s very highest 
alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4600  which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line 
alabama s threshold is the lowest among the <!DIGIT!> states and the district of columbia with income taxes 
the corporate income tax rate is currently <!DIGIT!> % 
the overall federal  state  and local tax burden in alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country 
property taxes are the lowest in the united states 
the current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes 
one of its amendments lowered the percentage of fair-market value at which property was taxed and another declared that timber and farmland would be taxed on the value of its current use instead of what the land is worth 
since alabama s tax structure largely depends on consumer spending  it is subject to high variable budget structure 
for example  in <!DIGIT!> alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670million 
it is one of only a few handful of states to accomplish large surpluses  with a budget surplus of nearly $12billion in <!DIGIT!>  and estimated at more than $21billion for <!DIGIT!> however  the declining national economy in <!DIGIT!> has eliminated that surplus and the state is again facing shortfall  with the governor declaring  proration   which will result in an immeditate education budget cut and school layoffs 
transportation 
alabama has five major interstate roads that cross it  i-65 runs northsouth roughly through the middle of the state  i-59/ i-20 travels from the central west border to birmingham  where i-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state and i-20 continues east towards atlanta  i-85 originates in montgomery and runs east-northeast to the georgia border  providing a main thoroughfare to atlanta  and i-10 traverses the southernmost portion of the state  running from west to east through mobile 
another interstate road  i-22  is currently under construction 
when completed around <!DIGIT!> it will connect birmingham with memphis  tennessee 
several us highways also pass through the state  such as us <!DIGIT!>  us <!DIGIT!>  us <!DIGIT!>  us <!DIGIT!>  us <!DIGIT!>  us <!DIGIT!>  us <!DIGIT!>  us <!DIGIT!>  us <!DIGIT!>  us <!DIGIT!>  us <!DIGIT!>  and us <!DIGIT!> major airports in alabama include birmingham-shuttlesworth international airport  bhm   dothan regional airport  dhn   huntsville international airport  hsv   mobile regional airport  mob   montgomery regional airport  mgm   muscle shoals  northwest alabama regional airport  msl   tuscaloosa regional airport  tcl   and pryor field regional airport  dcu  
for rail transport  amtrak schedules the crescent  a daily passenger train  running from new york to new orleans with stops at anniston  birmingham  and tuscaloosa 
state government 
the foundational document for alabama s government is the alabama constitution  which was ratified in <!DIGIT!> at almost <!DIGIT!> amendments and <!DIGIT!> words  it is the world s longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the u s constitution 
there is a significant movement to rewrite and modernize alabama s constitution 
this movement is based upon the fact that alabama s constitution highly centralizes power in montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands 
any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire alabama legislature and  frequently  by state referendum 
one criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length were intentional to codify segregation and racism 
alabama is divided into three equal branches  the legislative branch is the alabama legislature  a bicameral assembly composed of the alabama house of representatives  with <!DIGIT!> members  and the alabama senate  with <!DIGIT!> members 
the legislature is responsible for writing  debating  passing  or defeating state legislation 
the executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws 
it is headed by the governor of alabama 
other members of executive branch include the cabinet  the attorney general of alabama  the alabama secretary of state  the alabama commissioner of agriculture and industries  the alabama state treasurer  and the alabama state auditor 
the judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases 
the highest court is the supreme court of alabama 
local and county government 
alabama has <!DIGIT!> counties 
each county has its own elected legislative branch  usually called the county commission  which usually also has executive authority in the county 
due to the restraints placed in the alabama constitution  all but seven counties  jefferson  lee  mobile  madison  montgomery  shelby  and tuscaloosa  in the state have little to no home rule 
instead  most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning 
alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state  the government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol 
however  counties can declare themselves  dry   the state does not sell alcohol in those areas 
state politics 
the current governor of the state is republican bob riley 
the lieutenant governor is jim folsom jr the democratic party currently holds a large majority in both houses of the legislature 
due to the legislature s power to override a gubernatorial veto by a mere simple majority  most state legislatures require a <!DIGIT!> <!DIGIT!> majority to override a veto   the relationship between the executive and legislative branches can be easily strained when different parties control the branches 
during reconstruction following the american civil war  alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope 
in <!DIGIT!>  the political coalition known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans  in part by suppressing the african american vote 
after <!DIGIT!>  a coalition of whites passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise black residents  a process completed in provisions of the <!DIGIT!> constitution 
provisions which disfranchised african americans also disfranchised poor whites  however 
by <!DIGIT!> more whites than blacks had been disfranchised  <!DIGIT!> to <!DIGIT!>  although the impact was greater on the african-american community  as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised 
from <!DIGIT!> to the <!DIGIT!>  the state legislature failed to perform redistricting as population grew and shifted within the state 
the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in <!DIGIT!> with the disfranchisement of african americans  the state became part of the  solid south   a one-party system in which the democratic party became essentially the only political party in every southern state 
for nearly <!DIGIT!>  local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary  with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election 
in the <!DIGIT!> democratic primary election  the then-incumbent lieutenant governor lost the democratic nomination for governor 
the state democratic party invalidated the election and placed the lieutenant governor s name on the ballot as the democratic candidate instead of the candidate chosen in the primary 
the voters of the state revolted at what they perceived as disenfranchisement of their right to vote and elected the republican challenger guy hunt as governor 
this was the first republican governor elected in alabama since reconstruction 
since then  republicans have been increasingly elected to state offices until in <!DIGIT!> democrats were barely holding a majority in the state legislature 
since <!DIGIT!>  only one democrat  don siegelman  has managed to win the governor s office 
a corruption probe and eventual trial  the timing of which coincided with the <!DIGIT!> state primary  relegated siegelman to one term 
alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the <!DIGIT!> and <!DIGIT!> during the american civil rights movement  when majority whites bureaucratically  and at times  violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform 
george wallace  the state s governor  remains a notorious and controversial figure 
only with the passage of the civil rights act of <!DIGIT!> and voting rights act of <!DIGIT!> did african americans regain suffrage and other civil rights 
in <!DIGIT!>  the alabama legislature passed  and the governor signed  a resolution expressing  profound regret  over slavery and its lingering impact 
in a symbolic ceremony  the bill was signed in the alabama state capitol  which housed congress of the confederate states of america 
national politics 
from <!DIGIT!> through <!DIGIT!>  alabama supported only democratic presidential candidates  by large margins 
<!DIGIT!> was a curious election 
the democrats won with john f kennedy on the ballot  but the democratic electors from alabama gave <!DIGIT!> of their <!DIGIT!> electoral votes as a protest to harry byrd 
in <!DIGIT!>  republican barry goldwater carried the state  in part because of his opposition to the <!DIGIT!> civil rights act  which restored the franchise for african americans 
in the <!DIGIT!> presidential election  alabama supported native son and american independent party candidate george wallace over both richard nixon and hubert humphrey 
in <!DIGIT!>  democratic candidate jimmy carter from georgia carried the state  the region  and the nation  but democratic control of the region slipped after that 
since <!DIGIT!>  conservative alabama voters have increasingly voted for republican candidates at the federal level  especially in presidential elections 
by contrast  democratic candidates have been elected to many state-level offices and comprise a longstanding majority in the alabama legislature  see dixiecrat 
in <!DIGIT!>  george w bush won alabama s nine electoral votes by a margin of <!DIGIT!> percentage points with <!DIGIT!> % of the vote  mostly white voters 
the eleven counties that voted democratic were black belt counties  where african americans are the majority racial group 
the state s two u s senators are jefferson b sessions iii and richard c shelby  both republicans 
in the u s house of representatives  the state is represented by seven members  four of whom are republicans   jo bonner  mike d rogers  robert aderholt  and spencer bachus  and three are democrats   bobby bright  parker griffith and artur davis  
primary and secondary education 
public primary and secondary education in alabama is under the overview of the alabama state board of education as well as local oversight by <!DIGIT!> county school boards and <!DIGIT!> city boards of education 
together  <!DIGIT!> individual schools provide education for <!DIGIT!> elementary and secondary students 
public school funding is appropriated through the alabama legislature through the education trust fund 
in fy <!DIGIT!>  alabama appropriated $3775163578 for primary and secondary education 
that represented an increase of $444736387 over the previous fiscal year 
in <!DIGIT!>  over <!DIGIT!> percent of schools made adequate yearly progress  ayp  toward student proficiency under the national no child left behind law  using measures determined by the state of alabama  not the federal government  
in <!DIGIT!>  only <!DIGIT!> percent of schools met ayp 
however  while alabama s public education system has improved  it still lags behind in achievement compared to other states 
according to u s census data  alabama s high school graduation rate--75%--is the second lowest in the united states  after mississippi  
the largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees 
colleges and universities 
alabama s programs of higher education include <!DIGIT!> four-year public universities  numerous two-year community colleges  and <!DIGIT!> private  undergraduate and graduate universities 
public  post-secondary education in alabama is overseen by the alabama commission on higher education 
colleges and universities in alabama offer degree programs from <!DIGIT!> associate degrees to <!DIGIT!> doctoral level programs 
accreditation of academic programs is through the southern association of schools and colleges as well as a variety of subject focused national and international accreditation agencies

achilles 
in greek mythology  achilles  also  akhilleus or  achilleus  ancient greek   was a greek hero of the trojan war  the central character and the greatest warrior of homer s  iliad   which takes for its theme  the  wrath of achilles  
achilles also has the attributes of being the most handsome of the heroes assembled against troy  as well as the best 
later legends  beginning with a poem by statius in the first century ad  state that achillies was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel 
these legends state that achilles was killed in battle by an arrow to the heel  and so an  achilles  heel  has come to mean a person s principal weakness 
birth 
achilles was the son of the nymph thetis and peleus  the king of the myrmidons 
zeus and poseidon had been rivals for the hand of thetis until prometheus  the fire-bringer  warned zeus of a prophecy that thetis would bear a son greater than his father 
for this reason  the two gods withdrew their pursuit  and had her wed peleus 
as with most mythology there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events  in  argonautica   iv760  hera alludes to thetis s chaste resistance to the advances of zeus  that thetis was so loyal to hera s marriage bond that she coolly rejected him 
according to a fragment of an  achilleis  - the  achilleid   written by statius in the first century ad  and to no other sources  when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river styx 
however  he was left vulnerable at the part of the body she held him by  his heel 
see achilles heel  achilles  tendon 
it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier 
in another version of this story  thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body 
she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage 
however none of the sources before statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability 
to the contrary  in the  iliad  homer mentions achilles being wounded  in book <!DIGIT!> the paeonian hero asteropaeus  son of pelagon  challenged achilles by the river scamander 
he cast two spears at once  one grazed achilles  elbow   drawing a spurt of blood 
also in the fragmentary poems of the epic cycle in which we can find description of the hero s death  kpria  unknown author    aithiopis  by arctinus of miletus   ilias mikr  by lesche of mytilene  iliou prsis by arctinus of miletus  there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness  heel   in the later vase-paintings presenting achilles  death  the arrow  or in many cases  arrows  hit his body 
peleus entrusted achilles to chiron the centaur  on mt 
pelion  to be raised 
achilles in the trojan war 
the first two lines of the  iliad  read  achilles is the only mortal to experience consuming rage   menis   
his anger is at some times wavering  but at other times he cannot be cooled 
the humanization of achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative 
telephus 
when the greeks left for the trojan war  they accidentally stopped in mysia  ruled by king telephus 
in the resulting battle  achilles gave telephus a wound that would not heal  telephus consulted an oracle  who stated that  he that wounded shall heal  
guided by the oracle  he arrived at argos  where achilles heals him in order that he become their guide for the voyage to troy 
according to other reports in euripides  lost play about telephus  he went to aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound 
achilles refused  claiming to have no medical knowledge 
alternatively  telephus held orestes for ransom  the ransom being achilles  aid in healing the wound 
odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound  therefore  the spear must be able to heal it 
pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed cycnus of colonae 
according to the cypria of the epic cycle and traditions related by plutarch and the byzantine scholar john tzetzes  once the greek ships arrived in troy  achilles fought and killed cycnus of colonae  a son of poseidon 
troilus 
according to the cypria  the part of the epic cycle that tells the events of the trojan war before achilles  wrath   when the achaeans desired to return home  they were restrained by achilles  who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas  sacked neighboring cities and killed troilus 
according to dares phrygius   account of the destruction of troy   the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe  troilus was a young trojan prince  the youngest of king priam s  or sometimes apollo  and hecuba s five legitimate sons 
despite his youth  he was one of the main trojan war leaders 
prophecies linked troilus  fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed and decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of apollo by achilles 
in this version of the myth  achilles  death came in retribution for a sacrilege he had previously committed  his decapitation of troilus upon an altar-omphalos of apollo 
ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents 
had troilus lived to adulthood  the first vatican mythographer claimed troy would have been invincible 
in the  iliad  
homer s  iliad  is the most famous narrative of achilles  deeds in the trojan war 
the heroic epic only covers a few weeks of the war  and does not narrate achilles  death 
it begins with achilles  withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by agamemnon  the commander of the achaean forces 
agamemnon had taken a woman named chryseis as his slave 
her father chryses  a priest of apollo  begged agamemnon to return her to him 
agamemnon refused and apollo sent a plague amongst the greeks 
the prophet calchas correctly determined the source of the troubles but would not speak unless achilles vowed to protect him 
achilles did so and calchas declared chryseis must be returned to her father 
agamemnon consented  but then commanded that achilles  battle prize briseis be brought to replace chryseis 
angry at the dishonor  and as he says later  because he loved briseis  and at the urging of thetis  achilles refused to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces 
as the battle turned against the greeks  nestor declared that the trojans were winning because agamemnon had angered achilles  and urged the king to appease the warrior 
agamemnon agreed and sent odysseus and two other chieftains to achilles with the offer of the return of briseis and other gifts 
achilles refused and urged the greeks to sail home as he was planning to do 
eventually  however  hoping to retain glory despite his absence from the battle  achilles prayed to his mother thetis  asking her to plead with zeus to allow the trojans to push back the greek forces 
the trojans  led by hector  subsequently pushed the greek army back toward the beaches and assaulted the greek ships 
with the greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction  patroclus led the myrmidons into battle  though achilles remained at his camp 
patroclus succeeded in pushing the trojans back from the beaches  but was killed by hector before he could lead a proper assault on the city of troy 
achilles  revenge on hector 
after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus  the son of nestor  achilles grieved over his close friend s death and held many funeral games in his honor 
his mother thetis came to comfort the distraught achilles 
she persuaded hephaestus to make new armor for him  in place of the armor that patroclus had been wearing which was taken by hector 
the new armor included the shield of achilles  described in great detail by the poet 
enraged over the death of patroclus  achilles ended his refusal to fight and took the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector 
achilles even engaged in battle with the river god scamander who became angry that achilles was choking his waters with all the men he killed 
the god tried to drown achilles but was stopped by hera and hephaestus 
zeus himself took note of achilles  rage and sent the gods to restrain him so that he would not go on to sack troy itself  seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles could defy fate itself as troy was not meant to be destroyed yet 
finally achilles found his prey 
achilles chased hector around the wall of troy three times before athena  in the form of hector s favorite and dearest brother  deiphobus  persuaded hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face 
after hector realized the trick  he knew his death was inevitable and accepted his fate 
hector  wanting to go down fighting  charged at achilles with his only weapon  his sword 
achilles got his vengeance  killing hector with a single blow to the neck 
he then tied hector s body to his chariot and dragged it around the battlefield for nine days with the assistance of the god hermes  hector s father  priam  went to achilles  tent to plead with achilles to permit him to perform for hector his funeral rites 
the final passage in the  iliad  is hector s funeral  after which the doom of troy was just a matter of time 
penthesilea 
achilles  after his temporary truce with priam  fought and killed the amazonian warrior queen penthesilea  but later grieved over her death 
at first  he was so distracted by her beauty  he did not fight as intensely as usual 
once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life  due to penthesilia s superior fighting skills  he refocused  and killed her 
as he grieved over the death of such a rare beauty  a notorius greek jeerer by the name of thersites laughed and mocked the great achilles 
annoyed by his insensitivity and disrespect  achilles punched him in the face and killed him instantly 
memnon  and the fall of the achilles 
following the death of patroclus  achilles s closest companion was nestor s son antilochus 
when memnon  king of ethiopia killed antilochus  achilles was once again drawn onto the battlefield to seek revenge 
the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus  except that memnon  unlike hector  was also the son of a goddess 
many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the  iliad s description of the death of patroclus and achilles s reaction to it 
the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic  aethiopis   which was composed after the  iliad   possibly in the <!DIGIT!> century b c the  aethiopis  is now lost  except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors 
as predicted by hector with his dying breath  achilles was thereafter killed by paris with an arrow  to the heel according to statius  
in some versions  the god apollo guided paris s arrow 
both versions conspicuously deny the killer any sort of valor owing to the common conception that paris was a coward and not the man his brother hector was  and achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield 
his bones were mingled with those of patroclus  and funeral games were held 
he was represented in the lost trojan war epic of arctinus of miletus as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube  see below  
another version of achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses  polyxena  achilles asks priam for polyxena s hand in marriage 
priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alligance with the world s greatest warrior 
but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles  paris who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with a divine arrow killing him 
paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles 
the fate of achilles s armor 
achilles s armor was the object of a feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax  ajax the greater  
they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners  who after considering both men came to a consensus 
odysseus won 
furious  ajax cursed odysseus  which earned the ire of athena 
athena temporarily made ajax mad with grief and anguish as he began killing sheep  thinking they were his comrades 
after a while  athena had lifted the madness and ajax had seen that he had actually been killing sheep 
in his embarrassment  he then committed suicide 
odysseus eventually gave the armor to neoptolemus  the son of achilles 
a relic claimed to be achilles  bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis  lycia  a port on the pamphylian gulf 
the city was visited in <!DIGIT!> by alexander the great  who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the  iliad  with him  but his courtbiographers do not mention the spear  which he would indeed have touched with excitement 
but it was being shown in the time of pausanias in the second century ce
